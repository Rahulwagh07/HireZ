### Frontend
The front  is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, critical for providing an engaging user experience. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.

 
## Features and Functionalities for frontend: üìã

- ‚ö°Ô∏èUser authentication
- ‚ö°Ô∏èJob posting and searching
- ‚ö°Ô∏èResponsive design for various screen sizes

## Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools Used for frontend:
 
- ‚ö°Ô∏èReactJS
- ‚ö°Ô∏èRedux Toolkit
- ‚ö°Ô∏èAxios for HTTP requests
- ‚ö°Ô∏èReact Router for client-side routing

### Back-end
The back end  is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing scalable and robust server-side functionalities. It offers APIs for user authentication, job posting, and other core features.

## Features and Functionalities for backend: üìã


- ‚ö°Ô∏èUser authentication using JWT
- ‚ö°Ô∏èRESTful API 
- ‚ö°Ô∏èData validation and error handling

## Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools Used for backend:


- ‚ö°Ô∏èNode.js
- ‚ö°Ô∏èExpress.js
- ‚ö°Ô∏èMongoDB for database storage
- ‚ö°Ô∏èJWT for authentication
- ‚ö°Ô∏èBcrypt for password hashing
- ‚ö°Ô∏èMongoose for MongoDB object modeling

### Database
The MongoDb database is used, a NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability for data storage.

### System Architecture
The project consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. It follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

### API Design
